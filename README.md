# Safe-EF: Error Feedback with Safety Constraints for Federated Learning ‚ö°

**Efficient and Safe Federated Learning!**

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. However, communication bottlenecks severely hinder its efficiency due to the high-dimensional nature of model updates. While contractive compressors (e.g., Top-$K$) can alleviate this issue, they often degrade performance without proper handling. **Safe-EF** tackles this challenge by integrating **error feedback (EF) with safety constraints**, ensuring both efficiency and robustness in federated learning.

### Key Idea üåê
- **Communication-Efficient Learning**: Employs contractive compression (e.g., Top-$K$) to reduce communication costs.
- **Error Feedback for Stability**: Mitigates the adverse effects of compression to maintain convergence speed and accuracy.
- **Safety Constraints**: Ensures feasible updates, even in non-smooth convex settings, making it practical for real-world applications.
- **Scalability & Robustness**: Extends to stochastic settings and large-scale federated learning setups.
